# Airport Review

  Airport Review is an app which allows a user to document their airport experiences and view other user
  experiences.

  A user simply will create an account.  Once logged in, a user can create, read, update or delete their review of an airport.  New airports can be added into the app as well.  

  Reviewing of airports provides users valuable knowledge - allowing for better planning and decision making.  

  Navingating through the app is simple, [a video walkthrough is available for clarity](http://).
